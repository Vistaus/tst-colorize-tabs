This [TST](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) addon allows to set individual color for each tab in order to highlight it.
Currently available colors: red, green, blue, yellow, brown, purple, orange.


[TreeStyleTabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) extension is required for it to run.

It may conflict with other extensions which change tabs color, such as [VivaldiFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/vivaldifox/) or [TST Colored Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tst-colored-tabs/)
